# Google Authentication with Firebase - Simple Setup

## Problem
Google authentication needs a redirect URI to be configured in Google Cloud Console.

## Solution
We'll use Firebase's built-in Google authentication with a simple redirect URI setup.

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Get the Redirect URI
When you run the app, check the console logs for the redirect URI. It should look like:
```
https://auth.expo.io/@your-username/your-app-slug
```

### 2. Add Redirect URI to Google Cloud Console
1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `messageai-bc582` (project-481795836565)
3. **Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials**
4. **Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID**: `481795836565-7q2pkujctdl4l8mt02uhma562umul896.apps.googleusercontent.com`
5. **Click Edit**
6. **Add the redirect URI** from the console logs to "Authorized redirect URIs"
7. **Save the changes**

### 3. Test Google Authentication
1. **Run the app**: `npm start`
2. **Check console logs** for the exact redirect URI
3. **Add it to Google Cloud Console** exactly as shown
4. **Test Google Sign-In** again

## Expected Console Output
```
üåê Redirect URI: https://auth.expo.io/@flankalanka/messageai
üåê Make sure this redirect URI is registered in Google Cloud Console
```

## Why This Works
- Firebase handles the Google authentication
- We just need to configure the redirect URI
- No complex OAuth setup required
- Works in Expo Go

## Alternative: Use Firebase Auth UI
If you want to avoid Google Cloud Console completely, you can use Firebase's pre-built authentication UI which handles everything automatically.

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Google Authentication**: Re-enabled with Firebase integration
‚úÖ **Email/Password**: Still working perfectly
‚úÖ **User Profiles**: Full profile management
‚úÖ **Account Management**: Complete account functionality

The Google authentication should now work with just the redirect URI configuration!
