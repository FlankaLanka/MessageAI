- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Test with various audio file sizes and formats

#### Risk Assessment:
**High Risk**: Voice message translation is a core feature that users expect to work
**Impact**: Users cannot translate voice messages, reducing app functionality
**Urgency**: Needs immediate attention and comprehensive testing
**Dependencies**: OpenAI API, Firebase Storage, local file system access
- **Quality**: Focus on reliability and offline resilience
