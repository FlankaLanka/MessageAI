## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Project Structure
- **Decision**: Using Expo for rapid development and cross-platform deployment
- **Rationale**: Faster development cycle, easier testing, simplified deployment
- **Consideration**: May need custom native modules for advanced features

### 2. State Management
- **Decision**: Zustand for state management
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, TypeScript-friendly, simple API
- **Consideration**: May need to add persistence layer for offline state

### 3. Database Architecture
- **Decision**: Firebase Firestore for primary data, SQLite for local caching
- **Rationale**: Real-time sync with offline resilience
- **Consideration**: Need to implement proper conflict resolution

### 4. Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: Firebase Auth with multiple providers
- **Rationale**: Secure, scalable, multiple sign-in options
- **Consideration**: Need to handle verification flows properly

## Current Priorities

### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Project Initialization** ✅
   - Expo project with TypeScript configured
   - All dependencies installed and working
   - Firebase project configured with API keys

2. **Authentication System** ✅
   - Firebase Auth with email/password and Google sign-in
   - User profile management with firstName/lastName
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

3. **Core Messaging** ✅
   - Firestore collections for messages and users
   - Real-time chat interface with optimistic UI
   - Message status tracking (sending, sent, failed)

4. **Responsive UI** ✅
   - SafeAreaView for all device types
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Touch-friendly interface with proper spacing

### Development Approach
- **Build Vertically**: Complete one feature at a time
- **Test Early**: Validate each feature with real devices
- **Document Progress**: Update memory bank as features are completed

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Offline Resilience
- **Challenge**: Maintaining message queue during network interruptions
- **Solution**: SQLite local storage with sync on reconnect
- **Implementation**: Need to handle conflict resolution and retry logic

### 2. Real-time Performance
- **Challenge**: Smooth real-time updates without performance issues
- **Solution**: Optimistic UI with proper state management
- **Implementation**: Need to optimize Firestore subscriptions

### 3. Cross-platform Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent behavior across iOS and Android
- **Solution**: Use Expo's cross-platform APIs
- **Implementation**: Test on both platforms regularly

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Firebase Limitations
- **Risk**: Rate limits or pricing issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper caching and optimize queries
- **Monitoring**: Track usage and implement fallbacks

### 2. Offline Complexity
- **Risk**: Complex offline state management
- **Mitigation**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Testing**: Comprehensive offline testing scenarios

### 3. Performance Issues
- **Risk**: App performance with large message histories
- **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and lazy loading
- **Monitoring**: Profile app performance regularly

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Messages deliver within 1 second
- Offline queue works reliably
- App performance remains smooth with 1000+ messages
- Cross-platform behavior is consistent

### User Experience Metrics
- Authentication flow completes in under 30 seconds
