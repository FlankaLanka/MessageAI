**Impact**: Chat leaving functionality now works without SQLite errors
**Priority**: COMPLETED - SQLite method missing error resolved

### **Method Added:**
```typescript
async removeUserFromChat(chatId: string, userId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Deletes entire chat from cache when user leaves
  // Since SQLite doesn't store participant lists separately
  await this.deleteChatFromCache(chatId);
}
```

### **Error Resolution:**
- **Before**: `this.sqliteService.removeUserFromChat is not a function`
- **After**: Method exists and chat leaving works without errors
- **Implementation**: Uses existing `deleteChatFromCache` method for simplicity

## ‚úÖ TRANSLATION CACHING SYSTEM - COMPLETED
**Status**: Translation caching system fully implemented and working

## üîç SMART SUGGESTIONS RAG PERFORMANCE - INVESTIGATED
**Status**: RAG toggle functionality investigated, performance issues identified
**Impact**: RAG toggle works but has performance bottlenecks
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Performance optimizations needed for RAG functionality

### **Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **RAG Toggle Works**: The toggle does control RAG vs recent messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Issues**: RAG context retrieval has bottlenecks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Empty Query Context**: RAG searches with empty string, reducing effectiveness
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Supabase Dependencies**: RAG requires proper Supabase Vector setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fallback Overhead**: When RAG fails, fallback adds overhead instead of speed

### **Performance Bottlenecks Identified:**
1. **Empty Query Issue**: `currentMessage: ''` means RAG searches with empty string
2. **Supabase Dependencies**: Requires proper Vector database setup
3. **Double Context Loading**: Loads both RAG and recent messages when enabled
4. **Fallback Overhead**: Error handling adds overhead instead of speed

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Fix Empty Query Issue**: Use recent messages as query context instead of empty string
2. **Add Performance Logging**: Track actual RAG vs non-RAG performance
3. **Simplify RAG Logic**: When RAG is disabled, don't call Supabase at all
4. **Add Configuration Check**: Show user if RAG is actually available

## üö® EXPO GO PUSH NOTIFICATION LIMITATIONS - DISCOVERED
**Status**: Push notifications do NOT work in Expo Go development environment
